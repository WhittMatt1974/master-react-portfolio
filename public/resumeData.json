The time savings will allow us to shift resources to Philly and Chicago roll outs.  Matt presented to ops today and they are also very excited to get this rolled out.  We will be starting the pilot in NYC within the next few weeks. I really appreciate you giving us the ability to streamlines this process; Matt really thought outside of the box to come up with a great solution that appeared to take little resources.  It is a big win for all of us.",
